# Remora: The Past in Your Pocket

## Problem Statement
People capture countless photos and recordings, but these memories often get buried in phone galleries with no meaningful connection to the places where they were created.  
Existing online solutions are frequently data-heavy and inaccessible in areas with poor or no internet connectivity.  
There is currently no simple way for individuals to relive moments tied to specific real-world locations without scrolling endlessly through large media folders.
